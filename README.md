## Part 3

- **File: `assignment_3_queries.pdf`**  
  Description: This PDF provides details and queries for Part 3 of the assignment. All components are structured as specified in the assignment guidelines.
  
- **Database Setup**: A demo database has been created and is utilized for testing purposes. A screenshot of the database setup is attached for reference.

## Assumptions

Throughout the development of this assignment, several assumptions were made to guide the implementation and design choices:

1. **Database Availability**: It is assumed that a database is available for testing, and that the structure of the tables aligns with the provided schema. The demo database created for Part 3 is based on this assumption.

2. **Error Handling**: The code is developed with the assumption that proper error handling mechanisms are in place, allowing for graceful recovery from unexpected issues.
